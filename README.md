
OSDriverPackage Module
======================

The "OSDriverPackage" PowerShell module is inspired by the great work of [David Segura](https://twitter.com/SeguraOSD) at https://www.osdeploy.com/, and a shameless derivate of the existing [OSDriver PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/OSDriver/).

The main intention for this module is to built some tooling around the Driver handling process described by David Seguara. It has been named differently to avoid possible conflicts with the already existing and published OSDriver module, as both modules are at very early stages yet and under heavy development.

We both appreciated all your feedback. There is very little documentation on this module for now and every aspect is due to constant change. Don't use it it even close to any production environment for now ;)
